                      A 'Set' consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same on each card OR is different on each card. That is to say, any feature in the 'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different on each card.
                    </p>
                    <p id="@when-you-find">
                      When you find three such cards, you can declare a 'Set'. If someone else is currently declaring, you must wait. If they fail, you will contest for declaration with anyone else trying to declare. If they succeed, all declarations will reset to account for the changing cards.
                    </p>
                    <p id="@if-you-believe">
                      If you believe there is no 'Set', you can vote to add cards. When all players agree that there is no 'Set' on the board, three more cards are laid face up. These cards are not replaced when the next 'Set' is picked up, reducing the number to its original count.
